## SpawnGuard

SpawnGuard is a mod designed to give players a grace period from mob attacks right after they spawn. Perfect for survival or challenge-based modpacks.

This mod allows players to safely settle into their world without the fear of being overwhelmed by hostile mobs. This mod works by applying a temporary effect that shields the player from damage, giving them time to gather resources and build defenses before facing the dangers of the world.

Also, there is the possibility of brewing a Potion of Mob Attack Protection that confers the same protection, allowing players to extend their safety beyond the initial spawn.

Whether it's a hardcore world or a custom scenario where initial safety is crucial, SpawnGuard makes for a smoother and more enjoyable experience right from the start.
